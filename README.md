<h1>Simple Python Calculator</h1>
A calculator very similar to our Javascript calculator, but made with Python's Tkinter library. We didn't package this one since everyone has a calculator in thier pocket, and our Javascript calculator is hosted and functional at https://symbioticlove.github.io/JsCalculator/.

If you would like to use this one, simply download python and execute the script. If you have desperate need of a packaged version, we can surely get you one. Just reach out to support@symbiotic.love!
